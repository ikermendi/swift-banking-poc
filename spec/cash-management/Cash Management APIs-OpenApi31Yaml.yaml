For example, this may be necessary in order to perform the appropriate liquidity management and the funds transfers between accounts. The API currently supports endpoint to get entries reported to the account, and/or to provide the owner with balance information on the account at a given point in time.\n\n`The API supports following functionalities:`\n\n* Retrieve list of account with balance information\n* Retrieve details of a specific account\n* Retrieve debit/credit entries reported to the account pending and booked items on the account at a given point in time to enable intraday reconciliation\n* Get account statement by the account owner, or authorised party, of the entries booked to the account, and to provide the owner with balance information on the account at a given point in time\n\n`Error Responses`\n\nThe API uses common HTTP status codes in the response header to indicate success or failure. Specific error code and description will be returned in the custom error schema.\n\n`Query Parameters`\n\nEach URL query parameter specifies an API query parameter that must be URL encoded.\n\n**v1.0.9 Release Notes**\n* All schema object containing \"oneOf\" syntax is updated to align with open API specification.\n* The header parameter X-ServiceProvider will be changed to X-UserContext.\n* PostalAddressUnstructured.country has been changed to optional.\n* An element CashAccount41.alternate_identification is added as a resource identifier where account identification cannot be used as a resource identification.\n* The element CashAccount41.linked_account  is changed to CashAccount41.related_account.\n* The elements CashCurrentBalance1.balance_type, CashAvailableBalance1.balance_type, CashForwardAvailableBalance1.balance_type has been dropped.\n* Batch indicator block to statement lines is added.\n* Return information block is added to Statement.\n* The charges block is added to Statement Entry details level.\n* The size of the element \"identification\" in both Statements and Statement Lines has been increased to 36 from 35 to accommodate UUID.\n\n**v1.0.8 Release Notes**\n* The query parameter account-servicer is added to the getAccounts endpoint.\n* Party identification object (Organisation/Person) in Statements and Statement Lines is changed to ISO component style. This is to address use case where identification of object is not always possible when only party name is available.\n* Account Identification in Statements and Statement Lines is aligned with ISO component.\n* Remittance Information, Purpose and Bank Transaction Code is added to Statement Lines.\n* The element interest, related_account is added to Statements    \n"

            RECOMMENDATION IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE:

            IBAN - International Bank Account Number (IBAN) - identifier used internationally by financial institutions to uniquely identify the account of a customer. Further specifications of the format and content of the IBAN can be found in the standard ISO 13616 "Banking and related financial services - International Bank Account Number (IBAN)" version 1997-10-01, or later revisions. When available IBAN must be specified for instance endpoint or hyper link to work.


            Other - Identifier used nationally by financial institutions, i.e., in individual countries, generally as part of a National Account Numbering Scheme(s), to uniquely identify the account of a customer. In the absence of IBAN, this must be an unique account identification used for routing of the payment to the account via clearing system. A format which is agreed between the account owner and the account servicer. For example a SWIFT BIC/Branch Code and Account number.

            IBAN - When available IBAN must be specified for instance endpoint or hyper link to work.

            Other - In the absence of IBAN, this must be an unique account identification used for routing of the payment to the account via clearing system. A format which is agreed between the account owner and the account servicer. For example a SWIFT BIC/Branch Code and Account number.

            IBAN - When available IBAN must be specified for instance endpoint or hyper link to work.

            Other - In the absence of IBAN, this must be an unique account identification used for routing of the payment to the account via clearing system. A format which is agreed between the account owner and the account servicer. For example a SWIFT BIC/Branch Code and Account number.

            IBAN - When available IBAN must be specified for instance endpoint or hyper link to work.

            Other - In the absence of IBAN, this must be an unique account identification used for routing of the payment to the account via clearing system. A format which is agreed between the account owner and the account servicer. For example a SWIFT BIC/Branch Code and Account number.
